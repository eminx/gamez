This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Introduction

This is a React application built with these features:
- to show a list of games
- allow the games to be filtered
- click and view detailed info about a game
- show a list of games being currently played by others/friends
- show additional info within the above list


# Running

After you clone the app, and go to the root repo, it is as simple as:

1- `npm i` to install dependencies locally

2- `npm start` to run the app locally

3- `npm run build` to build it locally

That's it.
